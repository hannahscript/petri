cell dna:
	- ideal temperature (-10 to 10)
		- if dist(t, it) <= 3, nothing
		- if dist(t, it) >= 4 and <= 7, energy gain halved
		- if dist(t, it) >= 8, cell loses dist(t, it) - 8 energy until it dies
cell state:
	- energy
		- if a cells energy reaches <= 0, it dies
		- if a cells energy reaches 50, it may spawn an adjacent cell. by doing so it loses half its energy
